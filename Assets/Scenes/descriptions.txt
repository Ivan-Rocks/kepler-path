Final-5.29
Pretty has all the functions we need. Added popping text whenever there are measuring clicks. However, toggles are not working fine.
Final-6.1
Fixed the toggle issue in 5.29 version. Need to implement and switch to hand-menu

Testing-Scene With Dialogues
Based on Final6.1 and added dialogues. Dialogues are working fine but everything is hard coded (API commandes, DialogPool, read CSV 
would not work on Hololens) Dialogue texts might be modified in the future. Might need to think of a better way to organize phases and controls. The controlling script here is called ControlsWithDialogues. Archived because current developing state might not need dialogues. 
Issue: APIs not working on Hololens
Will UPDATE when hand-menu is done.
